# Desktop Cats üêà - technical test

## Description

The ElectronJS application showcasing fun cat facts. This simple app fetches random cat-related data from public API and presents it on the desktop screen. The user can bookmark preferred fact, and see it on the favorites list. If desired, the user can turn on notifications feature to not miss any cat fact. The app was created as an tech test.

## Technologies

- **ElectronJS**: Cross-platform desktop application framework.
- **Electron Forge**: Boilerplate and tooling for Electron applications.
- **React**: Frontend UI library.
- **Material UI**: React components library.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript.
- **Webpack**: Module bundler.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for fetching data.
- **Jest** and **React Testing Library**: Testing tools.

## Running the Application

### Prerequisites:

**Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed.

### Steps:

#### Clone the repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/pszmurlo/electron-cats.git
```

#### Install dependencies:

```Bash
cd desktop-cats
npm install
```

#### (Optional) Start the development server:

```Bash
npm run start
```

#### Build the production-ready application:

```Bash
npm run make
```

## Potential Improvements (If I had more time)

- Add more complex testing, not just the simple test suite sample
- Prepare more visual-appealing and thoughtful UI design
- Care more about the typings
- Add suitable error handling
- Dig deeper into ElectronJS and use more of the possibilities it offers (as I was not familiar with that framework before taking the technical evaluation task)
